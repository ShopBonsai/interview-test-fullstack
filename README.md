# Bonsai React Interview Test

Hello! Thank you for considering me for this position. I have added a small number of features to this project as per the provided instructions. Design was not taken much into consideration here due to time constraints.

Features added:
- Cart function, showing total number of items in cart
- Popover on cart to show detailed view
- Ability to add and remove items to and from the cart, including quantity
- Search products by name (with debounced search)
- Filter results by size
