# Bonsai React Interview Test

Welcome to the creative interview test at Shop Bonsai.

This interview test simulates an environment that is similar to working at Shop Bonsai (very similar tech stack we run today).

Scenario:
You joined as the new member of a small start-up team. Together we are building a new app to sell cool 3rd party products! So far, the sales team worked tirelessly and managed to acquire over 50 merchants who each have different brands and products offerings. The developers have also been working hard and have created a home page and shop page to welcome the users and display the products of the newly acquired merchants.

Goal:
Your task is to add a new complete working feature that you feel will best demonstrate your capabilities as a team-member and have the largest positive impact on our customer. This implies that JUST updating the es-lint rules to include trailing commas, switching all space-characters in the code-base to tab-characters, and/or updating the .gitignore will score low. However, non-customer facing features such as validating data, unit-testing, creating a automatic-backups of the database, can score very high if done well.
